            "description": "Implemented quantum generative adversarial networks for high-energy physics simulations. Developed a novel architecture using quantum circuits with auxiliary registers for generating ECAL and HCAL detector images simultaneously. Successfully replicated energy deposit patterns in both channels while preserving implicit data correlations.",
